# Working Toegther 2025 

A game for the 2025 game jam with theme: Working Together. Bonus points for using the new Boards feature

This game features two parallell trees, red and blue. Each tree is dependent on the other, meaning you must progress in both to progress. 

Prestiging only reset one side or the other, meaning timing prestiges is important. 
Also new mechanic is the concept of slow autobuyers. Prestige Tree clones often feature upgrades that insta-auto-buy whole layers. 
This leads to pretty binary gameplay where you prpgress until you unlock a milestone or upgrade that renders manual actions obsolete. 

Instead we want to implement slow autobuyers, where a player is considerably faster at buying/progressing through. 
This presents players a choiceL they can idle their way through, or play active and be faster. Also the player can actually
SEE their autobuyers in action, and ties into the theme of Working Together: the autobuyers are actully working together in chains of slow progress
